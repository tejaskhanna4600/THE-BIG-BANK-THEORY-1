# STREAMLIT CLOUD REFRESH SOLUTION
==================================

## ❌ Problem Identified
Streamlit Cloud doesn't support the auto-refresh mechanism I implemented. Players have to manually refresh, which logs them out.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Problematic Auto-Refresh Code
- Removed `st.rerun()` loops that cause issues on Streamlit Cloud
- Removed JavaScript-based refresh that doesn't work reliably
- Simplified refresh mechanism

### 2. Added Manual Refresh Buttons
- **Main refresh button** in sidebar
- **Team-specific refresh button** on each team page
- **Clear instructions** for users

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Status indicators** show current game state
- **Time stamps** show last update
- **Clear instructions** on how to refresh
- **No logout on refresh** - session state preserved

## 🔄 How Refresh Works Now

### For Teams:
1. **Click "🔄 Refresh Now"** button on team page
2. **Or click "🔄 Refresh Game"** in sidebar
3. **Page updates** without logging out

### For Admin:
